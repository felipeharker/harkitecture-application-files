                    <p>Alexandria is dedicated to the research and development of computational design processes.
                        Specifically, Alexandria leverages artificial intelligence and parametric architectural design
                        workflows to design, document, and fabricate interior and exterior architectural products.</p>

                            <h3>Purpose</h3>

                            <hr>

                            <p>Alexandria's flagship product and primary focus is Alexandria Grasshopper Plugin, a tool built
                                for Rhinoceros 3D modeling application. The Plugin consists of a collection of user-facing
                                components, a web-based knowledge center, and a companion document, which showcases some of the
                                endless design possibilities Alexandria offers. Beyond the Plugin, Alexandria’s theoretical work
                                will include research, essays, articles, and documentation to be made publicly available through
                                the project website. The scope of research will include parametric/computational design, the
                                role of artificial intelligence in the design process, and the broader applications of both in
                                architectural design-build environments.</p>

                            <h4>Alexandria Grasshopper Plugin (Public Application)</h4>

                            <p>
                               Alexandria’s Grasshopper Plugin simplifies complex parametric design workflows while preserving customizability and user input, designed for quickly onboarding novice designers and for assisting experienced users with their existing workflows. 
                            </p>

                            <h4>Parametric Design Companion Document and Design Catalog (Physical Media, PDF)</h4>

                            <p>
                                The Companion Document is a compilation of designs built using Alexandria which are fabricable and commercially-viable. Given the virtually infinite possibilities of parametric design, the Document is not comprehensive, rather it should be viewed as reference material. The Design Catalog is a combination of client-facing print and physical media which offers tangible samples of the work created by Alexandria. Physical samples are 3D-printed, laser-cut, CNC-milled, etc. to showcase the breadth of Alexandria’s capabilities.

                                Home to all of the work produced by Alexandria. Latest application releases, respective documentation as well as additional resources such as sample files (for download), case studies, and written research are available here. Each release (public beta, stable releases, and legacy) are published with accompanying sample files (called “Libraries”) and version release notes.
